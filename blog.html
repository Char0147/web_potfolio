           <p class="lead">The first thing that jumped out at me from Brown’s speech is the quote from Thomas Phinney “People can be affected by good typography without being actively aware of it”. At first I didn’t understand what Phinney meant by this but after some research it became apparent that typography really does speak louder than words. Some examples given on a website I looked at is ‘you wouldn’t write “rock and roll” with a cursive font, same way that you wouldn’t write “peace” in flashing boldfaced angular letters. The role of typography is to make a statement, at the same time as maximizing readability. I would like to finish on the comment that typography is as universal and changing just as quickly as the web. </p>

                <p class="lead">‘Accessibility isn’t just about disabled people, it’s making sure we can all access info on the web’. As Ball said accessibility is one of the biggest areas to consider when designing a web page but unfortunately this isn’t the case at the moment. When Ball ‘pretended’ to be blind for a week so that he could understand the area better he found that many blind people find that mobile versions of sites are a lot more accessible and therefore there is something wrong in the way that desktop browsers are designed. The way in which visually impaired people read browsers is using screen readers such as JAWS or an open source screen reader being NVDA. This doesn’t mean that designers should forget about the content because screen readers can still understand CSS. One thing that screen readers cannot understand and read is linked titles and therefore text such as ‘contact us’ which could be a vital part of the website is made inaccessible for the user. After researching the area myself I found a quote by Alasdair King, which I think to be quite powerful. “New technologies are introduced to the web all the time: all we can ask is that their developers address accessibility issues”.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Conquer the blank canvas. <span class="text-muted">Megan Fisher.</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">The main point I picked up on when listening to Megan Fisher is when designing the canvas there is a lot to think about including colour, type & layout and in order to ‘deal’ with this to the best you can there is a process in place. This process is called the ‘Design Process’. There are four stages inside this process, these being; getting to know the project, development strategy, bringing the project to life and finally making it shine. So Fisher defined the first point of getting to know the project in two words. Substance and Treatment. You need to ‘interrogate’ the client so you know what problems they are trying to solve with the new design. Which keywords are going to characterize the business? You also need to solve the ‘mission statement’ (Who, What, Why). The second point is the development strategy and the main point within this is the content, firstly thinking about the wireframe and using a grid. A good site that Fisher talked about and that I have looked at myself is 960.gs, the site talks about the purpose of using a grid and shows some good examples of websites where they have been used. In order for the site to be successful you also need to plan the design and this can be done through an inspiration sheet, which leads on to the third point of bringing the project to life. Typography and the way colour and shapes are used are ways in which you can emphasize elements and finally lighting and texture and both important in bring the project to life, making it shine and making it different to other projects.</p>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">The era of symbol fonts. <span class="text-muted">Brian Suda.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Reading through Suda’s article I found that the subject points that he picked up on were very vague and due to it being such an up and coming part of web typography I felt it necessary to research into the main points that he picked up on. I found an article by Rajesh Namese on the pros and cons of a symbol font called Awesome. The main reason that people are now using symbol fonts are for the simple fact that using images take up a lot of web space and therefore the overall loading time of the page is a lot slower. On top of this, if the images are made bigger there is a possibility that they will loose definition. Unlike this symbol font will not become distorted when expanded and can also be optimized for example changing the colour of the symbol so that it fits the website colour scheme and they become more ‘personal’. Thinking about another video I watched earlier on today about accessibility for visually impaired people, screen readers cannot read symbol font and just say it as a letter and therefore for people registered blind this is consider bad accessibility. When designing my blog, for the purpose that I am making it, I will be using symbol font as I think in my case the pros are out weighting the cons.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Designing in the Browser 2012. <span class="text-muted">Divya Manian.</span></h2>
                <p class="lead">Listening to Manian speak made me thing myself a lot about which is better, static mock-ups or HTML prototypes. A lot of interesting points were brought up at her conference speech, which I wanted to go and research further and this is what I found. The first thing that Manian said was ‘mock-ups are bad’, she says this due to a number of reasons such as they don’t reflect the live site and with the old workflow when the mock up is shown to the client if they want to make any alterations a new mock up will have to be made before it can be signed off. When designing a website it should be designed around the content and the user experience and the purpose needs to be fulfilled. The way in which this can be shown is through a HTML prototype. HTML prototypes show ‘the real thing’, and any breaks in the experience can be found easily allowing for tweaks to be made. A few things that Manian said that we shouldn’t be concerned about when prototyping is performance, pointless semantics and pixel/ layout perfection as this can be done when the prototype has been agreed by the client and the real thing is ready to be made. The things that we should pay attention to when building a prototype, is things such as sensible defaults, style pre processors, naming conventions and using real data.  When doing my own web design I will think back to this video and ensure that I use prototypes opposed to mock-ups to keep work levels down to a minimum and ensure that I keep in mind the points about ‘what to be concerned about’ in order to create a prototype which will reflect the live site and the user experience in the best way possible.

                <p class="lead">Collison has written a powerful article here basically saying that although you don’t want the user to see a complicated user interface that does not mean that the way in which it is made is kept minimal also. A strong paragraph that he wrote and explains this well is “ To paraphrase Einstein, simple doesn’t have to be simpler. In other words, simple doesn’t dictate that we remove the complexity. Complex doesn’t have to be confusing; it can be beautiful and elegant. The main point that Collison is trying to portray is not to fear complexity when designing websites and to embrace and tame it. ‘Work hard to empathize with audience needs, and you can create elegant, playful, risky, surprising, emotive, delightful and ultimately simple things’.

                <p class="lead">Hyper Text Markup Language also known as HTML is a way of adding font, colour, graphic and hyperlinks to web pages. As Asay shows through many graphs within his article (some shown below) HTML5 is fast approaching iOS. For people that can afford Apple the products are great but for those in less fortunate circumstances such as South Asia, South America, the Middle East and Africa iOS is in third place behind Android and HTML5. In some respects HTML5 developers actually do better that iOS developers and this can be seen in the graph left. As mobile markets become more demanding we will see an increase in developers using Android and HTML5. In conclusion, whilst HTML5 is only first priority for 26% of developers, it’s likely to become a necessary second option.

                <p class="lead">One of the first things that were shown in Rose’s presentation were screen shots of online articles titled ‘is Photoshop really dead?’ I found one of these articles myself and found it really interesting to read about how designing in the browser is becoming more popular and the use of Photoshop is dramatically decreasing. As long as you can understand CSS this seems to be the way forward. The biggest problem with designing in the browser is that any chosen font must be installed in the type kit else it will not appear. Just for comparison, Photoshop is; Expensive, crashes, non-interactive, is 2x the effort and has a fixed canvas where as designing in the browser is; free, stable, interactive, 1x the effort and has fluid canvas.

                <p class="lead">I fell that the points made in this video are very similar to that of Dan Rose’s Photoshop’s New Groove. As Fisher said, we are now living is a post PSD world. When designing web pages before you would create a mock up in Photoshop and every time you wanted to make a change you would have to change every PSD document as well. Now a days the main priorities for web designers is to design mockups in the browser. Doing this will enable interaction so the designer can see what looks best on the browser before making any decisions. Another reason for designing in the browser is that it has a fluid canvas and living in a world where designers are always thinking ‘mobile first’ this is very important.
